# Simple Palindrome Application 
This application validates user input and decide if the entered string is a palindrome or not. If you don't know what the palindrome is please follow this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).

3. Installed one of the supported browsers
    - Chrome (latest)

## How to run product
Run `npm run build` to build the product. Result of product is located in `dist` folder.

## How to develop
Run `npm run start` in main folder of project. It will start a web server that will serve the application at `http://localhost:8080` (by default)


## Todo
- Update a documentation how to run product. Probably some basic web server is enough. Should run production build.
- Production build
- Unit test
- E2E Tests. Use the solution from SV if possible.
- Implement a logic
- Style the application (atomic css probably the best but not necessary)
- implement palindrome function. As a library.
- Create a copy link for sent through email.
- Probably need of router because of link (not sure about it)
- visualize if the entered text is or is not a palindrome
